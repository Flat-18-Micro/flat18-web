      <p><b>Our limited liability company, FLAT 18 MICROSYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LLC, is sometimes referred to as:
          <i>@f18micro</i>,
          <i>F18</i>, <i>Flat 18</i>, <i>FLAT18.CO.UK</i> on different social and internet platforms.
          <br>Flat 18 and any project staged as a subdomain of <i>flat18.co.uk</i> are
          also governed by this document. The customer party will be referred to as <i>you</i>, <i>your</i>. Flat 18, the service-provider party, may be referred to as <i>us</i>, <i>we</i>,
          <i>our</i>.
        </b></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Our interactions with you and our work undertaken for you are governed by the terms and guidelines set out
        below.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Hours of Operation</h5>
      <p>
        Work at Flat 18 is conducted on highly-flexible schedules across multiple time-zones. Our availability to answer
        your questions and deal with queries, requests and other correspondences, is limited to our operating hours of
        09.00 - 17.00 "UTC" <i>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), UTC +0</i> or "GMT", Monday to Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will always be able to get a message to us, even outside of those hours and on weekends, but we will likely
        respond less promptly.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Engaging Flat 18 for work</h5>
      <p>You may contact us about developing your project via any of our primary channels: Telegram (@f18micro), website
        live-circle (https://flat18.co.uk), email (hello@flat18.co.uk).</p>
      <p>
        During our chats we help you decide if Flat 18 is the right development company for your project.
      </p>
      <p>You will be asked to provide as much detail on your project, as is practical. Budget-size and desired
        completion date are also valuable to us in determining how to plan for and cost your project.</p>
      <p>
        We will then give you prices, samples, technical outlines and data on planned approach, schedule, methodologies
        and strategies to be employed (depending on your project).
      </p>
      <p>
        We would be delighted if you should choose us to develop your project and at that point, we shall create an
        account for you identified by a name, nickname, pseudonym or contact detail. We will produce and send you a
        quotation document detailing the agreed scope, and outlines of your project.
      </p>
      <p>You can contact us at any time regarding your project, but we also encourage weekly meetings to discuss progress or other matters, via our website live-circle, telegram or voice-call.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Scheduling and Queueing</h5>
      <p>You will usually receive a quotation after discussing your project with us. Quotations accompany an invoice automatically, for convenience.</p>

      <p>Invoices for our Essentials Monthly package are due immediately since your development blocks of 40 hours must be paid for in advanced or pre-paid. Invoices for additional blocks of time or for our Flexible PAYG package are usually generated within the last week of a calendar month or at the end of a project, whichever is sooner. These invoices are due immediately since they apply to work already done.</p>

      <p>If your quotation does not
        include a planned date of commencement, we will begin development within 1-4 weeks of receiving a full payment
        of your invoice.</p>

      <p>We queue activities, reviews, jobs, changes and updates according to developer schedules and flow of work activities. This may mean that your development hours are likely to be distributed sporadically throughout a calendar month. You can always contact us for an update.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>Payment</h5>
      <p>Under normal circumstances, you should only pay an invoice for a new project if you would like to begin
        development work on that project.</p>
      <p>When using our Flexible PAYG package, 50% deposit will be required at the start of a project, for orders over 10 hours long or costing over <span class="currency-bundle"><span
        class="currency-symbol">£</span><span class="currency-value">500</span></span>.</p>

      <p>You may purchase development hours in blocks of 40 hours each as part of our Essentials Monthly package. We determine the exact spread of these hours
        over a calendar month. Development hours reset to 0 at the end of a calendar month and do not roll over. You may
        purchase additional blocks of 4-hour blocks if we can accommodate it. Rates will vary. You may choose to pause
        development on your project at any time to avoid needing to purchase additional hours. Monthly blocks of 50
        hours should be paid for in advance but additional hours can be paid for at any time during the same calendar
        month that they will be used in.</p>

      <p>You will be invited to join a git repository for your project before commencement. The repository will journal
        the progress of your project development and account for time spent by the commit record. Commits may not always
        be pushed at the time of commit.
      </p>

      <p>Sometimes, it becomes necessary for us to adjust your project schedule. In these rare situations, we will
        usually allow your development hours to roll over to the next month if necessary.</p>
      
      <p>If you change your mind about developing a project after you have paid, you shall be eligible for a refund of your unused hours less 4 hours at the agreed rate. You are also eligible to apply your development hours to another project which is either ongoing or scheduled to start/restart within 3 months.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Supply of Materials</h5>
      <p>
        You must supply all materials and information as we specify, when required. Such materials may include, but are not limited to: photographs, written copy, logos and other
        printed material, source-codes, log-in details, SSL certificates, API keys. Delays in providing these materials may cause undesired wasting of development hours since it may not be possible to use them within the calendar month, and they will not be allowed to roll over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should a delay on your part cause a project to cease development before completion by the end of a calendar month, your project will be automatically paused and you will not be invoiced for additional hours until we are able to review your project with you.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Communication</h5>
      <p>
        During development of your project, we encourage the creating of <i>Issues</i> on your git repository to track feedback and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will suggest at least one day of every week during which we should meet via text chat on your website live-circle, telegram or a voice call for at 10-30 minutes to discuss progress updates and voice any concerns. Due to time-constraints, we may schedule a further meeting/call to cover additional topics.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <h5>Support</h5>
      <p>
        In any case where a period of support or review period has not been defined, we will honour reasonable requests
        for technical support or revision of work delivered for up to one month after a project has been completed. For
        the purpose of efficiency, we limit support requests to 2 requests no less than 2 weeks apart. The period of
        support ends after 1 month (or the specified time) even if no request for revision or support has been made.
        We reserve the right to withhold support for any service for which payment is outstanding.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Variations</h5>
      <p>
        You may request as many reviews or changes to your project scope as you would like. Changes may be implemented in as little as 2 business days. More complicated updates or changes may require additional meetings and materials. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we consider a change or variation to be complicated and require additional dialogue and materials, we will inform you and temporarily cease development until we have reviewed your project with you.
      </p>

        
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Project Delays and Client Liability</h5>
      <p>
        Should a delay on your part cause a project to cease development before completion by the end of a calendar month, your project will be automatically paused and you will not be invoiced for additional hours until we are able to review your project with you.
      </p>
      <p>You will not be eligible to receive any refund of unused hours.</p>
    </li>
 
    <li>
      <h5 id="termination_of_service">Termination of Service</h5>
      <p>You may terminate a project at any time by contacting us via our website live-circle, telegram or a voice-call. You will be required to answer questions about your project to prove your identity and approve the termination.</p>
      <p>
        If have already paid for development hours, you shall be eligible for a refund of your unused hours less 4 hours at the agreed rate. You are also eligible to apply your development hours to another project which is either ongoing or scheduled to start/restart within 3 months.
      </p>
      <p>If development on your project has begun, you may not be entitled to a refund of any part of the unused hours. Your project will be paused and you will not be invoiced on the following month.</p>
      <p>Unused and unassigned hours are expired within 1 week from terminating the project. They cannot be used or refunded.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h5>Warranty by You as to Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights</h5>
      <p>
        You must obtain all necessary permissions and authorities in respect of the use of all copy, graphic images,
        registered company logos, names and trade marks, code, frameworks, applications, programmes or any other
        material that you supply to us to include in your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from any claims or legal actions related to the content of your
        project.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Licensing</h5>
      <p>
        Once you have paid us in full for our work we grant to you a license to use the product and its related software
        and contents for the life of the project excepting such software or content that is hosted by us and may be
        governed by a separate licensing policy.
      </p>

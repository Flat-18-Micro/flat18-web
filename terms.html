          <li><strong>Our limited liability company, FLAT 18 MICROSYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LLC, is sometimes referred to as: <em>@f18micro</em>, <em>F18</em>, <em>Flat 18</em>, <em>FLAT18.CO.UK</em> on different social and internet platforms.<br>Flat 18 and any project staged as a subdomain of <em>flat18.co.uk</em> are also governed by this document. The customer party will be referred to as <em>you</em>, <em>your</em>. Flat 18, the service-provider party, may be referred to as <em>us</em>, <em>we</em>, <em>our</em>.<br>‍</strong></li>
          <li>Our interactions with you and our work undertaken for you are governed by the terms and guidelines set out below.<br>‍</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Hours of Operation<br>Work at Flat 18 is conducted on highly-flexible schedules across multiple time-zones. Our availability to answer your questions and deal with queries, requests and other correspondences, is limited to our operating hours of 09.00 - 17.00 &quot;UTC&quot; <em>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), UTC +0</em> or &quot;GMT&quot;, Monday to Friday.<br><br>You will always be able to get a message to us, even outside of those hours and on weekends, but we will likely respond less promptly.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Engaging Flat 18 for work<br>You may contact us about developing your project via any of our primary channels: Telegram (@f18micro), website live-chat (https://flat18.co.uk), email (hello@flat18.co.uk).<br><br>During our chats we help you decide if Flat 18 is the right development company for your project.<br><br>You will be asked to provide as much detail on your project, as is practical. We samples, technical outlines and data on planned approach, schedule, methodologies and strategies to be employed (depending on your project).<br><br>We would be delighted if you should choose us to develop your project and at that point, we shall create an account for you identified by a name, nickname, pseudonym or contact detail. <br><br>The scope of your project will be recorded in a Mattermost Focalboard or other solution such as a Trello board.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Scheduling and Queueing<br>Invoices for our subscriptions are due immediately.<br><br>We queue activities, reviews, jobs, changes and updates according to developer schedules and flow of work activities. This may mean that your development hours are likely to be distributed sporadically throughout a calendar month. You can always contact us for a more in-depth update.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Payment<br>We accept fiat payments in USD, GBP, EUR.<br>We also accept Bitcoin, Ethereum and several ERC-20 tokens.<br><br>If you change your mind about developing a project after you have paid, you shall be eligible for a refund of up to 50% of the total paid.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Discounts and Promotions Validity<br>Unless otherwise agreed upon, prices which are discounted or marked down in an invoice are only valid before or on the invoice due date. If an invoice does not display a due date, the date of issue of the invoice is the due date. Invoice numbering scheme always denotes the invoice date of issue <em>(E.g.: INV-20230113-XXX which represents 13<sup>th</sup> January, 2023).</em> <br>Invoices paid after the due date shall be billed at full-price with no discount.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Supply of Materials<br>You must supply all materials and information as we specify, when required. Such materials may include, but are not limited to: photographs, written copy, logos and other printed material, source-codes, log-in details, SSL certificates, API keys. Delays in providing these materials may cause undesired wasting of development hours since it may not be possible to use them within the calendar month, and they will not be allowed to roll over.<br><br>Should a delay on your part cause a project to cease development before completion by the end of a calendar month, your project will be automatically paused and you will not be invoiced for additional hours until we are able to review your project with you.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Communication<br>During development of your project, we encourage the creating of <em>Issues</em> on your git repository to track feedback and implementation.<br><br>We will suggest at least one day of every week during which we should meet via text chat on your website live-circle, telegram or a voice call for at 10-30 minutes to discuss progress updates and voice any concerns. Due to time-constraints, we may schedule a further meeting/call to cover additional topics.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Support<br>In any case where a period of support or review period has not been defined, we will honour reasonable requests for technical support or revision of work delivered for up to one month after a project has been completed. For the purpose of efficiency, we limit support requests to 2 requests no less than 2 weeks apart. The period of support ends after 1 month (or the specified time) even if no request for revision or support has been made. We reserve the right to withhold support for any service for which payment is outstanding.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Variations<br>You may request as many reviews or changes to your project scope as you would like. Changes may be implemented in as little as 48 hours. More complicated updates or changes may require additional time.<br><br>If we consider a change or variation to be complicated and require additional dialogue and materials, we will inform you and temporarily cease development until we have reviewed your project with you.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Project Delays and Client Liability<br>Should a delay on your part cause a project to cease development before completion by the end of a calendar month, your project will be automatically paused.<br><br>You will not be eligible to receive any refund of unused hours.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Termination of Service<br>You may terminate a project at any time by contacting us via our website live-circle, telegram or a voice-call. You will be required to answer questions about your project to prove your identity and approve the termination.<br><br>You will generally be ineligible for refund. We may choose to apply credit to your account for unused time, however these decisions are made on individual cases.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Warranty by You as to Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights<br>You must obtain all necessary permissions and authorities in respect of the use of all copy, graphic images, registered company logos, names and trade marks, code, frameworks, applications, programmes or any other material that you supply to us to include in your project.<br><br>You agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from any claims or legal actions related to the content of your project.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Licensing<br>Once you have paid us in full for our work we grant to you a license to use the product and its related software and contents for the life of the project excepting such software or content that is hosted by us and may be governed by a separate licensing policy.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Search Engines<br>We do not guarantee any specific position in search engine results for your website. We perform basic search engine optimisation according to current best practice.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Consequential Loss<br>We shall not be liable for any loss or damage which you may suffer which is in any way attributable to any delay in performance or completion of our contract, however that delay arises.</li>

Additionally, all data collected regarding you, your business and your project is protected under our <a href="https://flat18.co.uk/privacy">privacy policy</a>.<br><br>It is standard procedure for Flat18 to inform you that you should change passwords or revoke any keys or security details provided to us for a project, once the project is completed or the authentication articles have become surplus to our requirements.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Additional Expenses<br>You agree to reimburse us for any requested expenses which do not form part of our proposal including but not limited to the purchase of templates, third party software, stock photographs, fonts, domain name registration, project hosting or comparable expenses.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Backups<br>You are responsible for maintaining your own backups with respect to your project and we will not be liable for restoring any client data or client websites and software except to the extent that such data loss arises out of a negligent act or omission by us.<br><br>Flat18-hosted or GutHub-hosted gits are not regarded and should not be treated like project backups.</li>
          <li class="list-item-3">Ownership of Domain Names and Hosting<br>We will supply to you account credentials for domain name registration and/or project hosting that we purchased on your behalf when you reimburse us for any expenses that we have incurred.</li>
